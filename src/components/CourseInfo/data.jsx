When you upload your notes you are not doing a small clerical task, you are extending a hand to hundreds of juniors you may never meet. Years later, someone might clear a concept, pass a course, or discover a new interest because of a document you chose to share today. That invisible chain of help and gratitude is what makes this place special.`,

                majority, you should select it in such a way that it either suits your major degree in

                it reflect in my final transcript?`,

                the course, under the additional courses done.`,

        subheading: `Q. What's the difference between an ALC, Audit and sitting through a course?`,
        description: `A. Additional Learning Courses (ALCs) do not count towards your CPI but are
                involved in tagging - if you tag it later as an elective, the grade you get then counts
                in your CPI. When you audit a course, you do it without obtaining a grade - you
                get an 'AU' on successful completion of the course, which does not carry grade
                points. Formal registration is required for both these, and they appear on your
                transcript. But for sitting through a course, you don't need to register for it, nor
                does it appear on your transcript.`,

                or can they take up Elective HS *yyy* in its place?`,
        description: `A. Yes, they can take *yyy* as their HSS elective by changing the tag of HS *xxx* to
                additional learning and registering for *yyy* in the next semester as HSS-Elective.`,

                for an honors degree?`,
        description: `A. If one has completed some honor courses but not enough to acquire an honors
                degree, then those courses would be counted under Additional learning Courses.
                Some departments allow to tag these as Department/other electives as well.`,

                minor; willthat course show up anywhere while passing out?`,
        description: `A. The grade that you obtained in the course will show up in the transcript. All the
                courses taken up as a minor are converted to an ALC unless you have completed
                30 prescribed minor credits in a particular department.`,
